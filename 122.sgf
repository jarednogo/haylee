Haylee: Nice to meet  you too!
Haylee: Have a good game!!
Ten: You too! The admins are setting up the stream, so let's wait just a bit until they're ready
Ten: And have fun, of course!
Haylee: Sure ;)
Ten: Ok, seems the stream is ready, let's go :)
calantir: This is gonna be so fun
mlopezviedma: welcome everyone!
dneg: i hope ppol kibitz
dneg: can't watch the stream
dneg: xD
calantir: the stream hasn't restarted yet
dneg: i mean my internet
calantir: but there will be plenty of kibitz here, you can count on that
Karet: Get the snacks while you still can
Ornable: the clear move is tengen here
KillerDucky: Do the players know what the last byoyomi period looks like?
dneg: do ten have any fave opening as b?
KillerDucky: What *does* it look like nowadays anyways
calantir: KillerDucky: we standardized it
ObieTwice: just told my SO that i was putting in headphones and ignoring the world for a bit :)
KillerDucky: ok it's standard... which means what?  :)
calantir: it means...the same as everywhere else?
mlopezviedma: it means it's like every other server
snowman: Nice exhibition event. Thanks OGS!
KillerDucky: on Tygem it says "the last overtime"
Oni: R16
KillerDucky: on KGS it says "SD"
calantir: You're welcome snowman, enjoy the game!
KillerDucky: here it says um... "1" I think?
Chinitsu: I'd bet R16 too
calantir: Yeah, think so KillerDucky 
Chinitsu: Q16 is not as popular nowadays
trib4l: on OGS it does 3..2.. timeout! :)
Jonasd: i thought it was one more hour? is the game starting now?
Oni: Jonasd: soon
ObieTwice: 10pm Chicago, USA time, Jonasd

  C[Samraku: Ooh, I would be too scared to play k5
Samraku: what happens after black h3?
Samraku: h2 connects, I guess
Chinitsu: I'm thinking about j4 actually
Fellow: what other than k5

  ;B[gm]
  C[ObieTwice: or white hanes on top and sacrifices small but reduces a lot? ... i have no idea what they're thinking though... #obviously
snowman: black wants to complete his shimari and white wants to prevent it
snowman: but is there time...

  ;W[em]
  C[calantir: which shimari - you mean on the right side?
snowman: mainly that, R4
]
  ;B[im]
  C[Samraku: If black plays r4 now, it seems like m3 has way less potential than if it were on the right side. Was that maybe a factor in Haylee's invasion?
Samraku: That m3 maybe isn't as efficient?

  ;W[lo]
  C[KillerDucky: the clone functionality is bugged?
Tarqeq: what does that sentence mean?
gooooo: means web client ftl
Chinitsu: they can't make more storm trooper

luckymedie: black is better
Chinitsu: black better
grolich: if you mean why did she invade so early, well... If she hadn't, one more black move on the bottom would have made it very difficult for white to do a lot about it.
calantir: hey grolich! great to see you
grolich: hey cal :) thanks. you too. I still come around once in a while, even when I haven't got a lot of time to stay and chat :) but I've made sure to be here this time :D
snowman: quite solid shapes so early

  C[ObieTwice: that is what i meant. but black seems to be doing well anyway. maybe even using the sequence advantageously
bearcat: hey everyone!
luckymedie: R8
Tarqeq: still half of the board for all those exciting roofs waiting for their walls to be built
Samraku: r8 looks like it would be hard to respond too
]
  ;B[cl]
  C[Samraku: ooh, getting exciting :)
arczyx: what is black aiming?
grolich: hmm I wonder if black just wants to use good forcing moves and get back to bottom right or if he plans to do more around here
Oni: to the side
kannikka: could be a probe?
luckymedie: black is winning the influential game
]
  ;W[eo]
  C[Tarqeq: /me daren't guess
gooooo: OT: this client is so much more developed than kgs
luckymedie: And leaving white with no great follow ups
Goprince: such an odd opening
Karet: Threatening the E7 and aiming for C14?
Chinitsu: gooooo client? what cient are you talking about?
Karet: C8 that is
gooooo: web client
Samraku: Well, if white gets another move in the lower right, hasn't all the influence been pretty much neutralized?
matburt: Thanks gooooo :)
arczyx: is playing there really worth that much compared to the right corner?
Nghtstalker: Goodluck to both players
arczyx: for both players
arczyx: it looks pretty small to me
JeansebL: Almost 200! :D
ObieTwice: gooooo: ogs devs are a good squad...
Nghtstalker: hard to choose who to root for.
gooooo: even though I have intense hate against running stuff in browser :)
JeansebL: And yeah goprince, I agree, dat opening, really entertaining XD
grolich: C8 was a good forcing move in sente... still possible (and likely) that black will get back to the lower right first 
gooooo: but nice work
dmf: more than things running in java??
Chinitsu: I have intense hate against installing any additional stuff on my computer
Tarqeq: Nightstalker: If both do well, it will be good for the game
anarhail: wms doesn't do anything so it's not surprising that kgs is outdated
Goprince: feels good for w

Lunar Dusk: Disclaimer: All of my non-insightful comments are gonna be biased in Haylee's favors

  ;B[pm]
  C[Samraku: What Lunar Dusk said :)
ObieTwice: who said R8.. i'd like to see review notes later arguing r7 v r8
grolich: currently, white doesn't have much in terms of points, but black has even less :) so black needs to use his superior influence. Which he may or may not be able to do :)

  C[Samraku: good point, grolich
luckymedie: K17 very big

  C[Optimusss: From what i See legt Bottom Group for Black is also Not 100% alive right?

  C[Ornable: it is now
Ornable: lol

  ;B[pp]
  C[Lunar Dusk: 200 boyz! We're there!
Tarqeq: left, not right
HowToPlay?: it was alive for awhile 
Optimusss: :)
asdf1234: haylee is nice and all but totally in favor of ten
Optimusss: Left one
HowToPlay?: yeah left is also alive 
Ornable: oh left
HowToPlay?: it can easily run out 
Samraku: but I think that if black omitted r3 then white could kill, though maybe black can squirm out? didn't read it very deeply
Bouch'sRevenge: left would be hard to kill
]
  ;W[qo]
  C[Oni: luckymedie: urgent points, before big points. Have't you watch your gogoigo's?
Ornable: that's why black invested moves in the center
luckymedie: I didn't say to go there.
Saint Ravitt: darev: if you're there then check our chat window.
Chinitsu: Q11?
anarhail: my counting is awful but i see maybe 15 solid points for w and generously 5 for b
Samraku: seems natural
luckymedie: F17 or K17
Tarqeq: O7 first?
Samraku: I see 11 points for white (plus upper left) and 4 points for black (plus upper right)
ObieTwice: Ornable: wondering the same.. seems to be an "investment" for later play... just not on the level to think like that though.. again, #obviously
Tarqeq: /me places his bet
Ornable: influence = indefinite points
Ornable: :D
ObieTwice: i am ddk.. what is influence? ;)
calantir: black's taking some time for this next move
Tarqeq: that is something that makes your moves stronger in certain areas than if you... didn't have influence there
arczyx: influence = basically thickness facing the center
arczyx: or something like that
Ornable: influence =/= thickness
chanbon: is aji the same as influence?
arczyx: no
anarhail: influence is yi chang ho's backstabbing ex-best friend
]
  ;B[pi]
  C[Chinitsu: yay I'm 1p

  ;W[qr]
  ;B[pr]
  C[Samraku: aji can destroy influence :)
Chinitsu: look mom!

  ;W[pq]
  C[calantir: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Influence
Karet: Aji = "oh ** I didn't see that one coming"
dmf: haha, nice Chinitsu 
calantir: is there a ko fight here?
kannikka: basicly black stones in the center don't make any points yet. so they are an investment on later, so you could use them to attack a group and make points later
Oni: hi kannikka
Chinitsu: hmm w win this ko she's completely alive here
Samraku: but black's alive anyway
kannikka: hello :)
Samraku: ohh, so that's the meaning of the ko
arczyx: but even if white lose the ko she can just connect?
recurse: that p3 opening isn't looking great now
arczyx: o6 or o5
]
  ;B[qs]
  C[Samraku: true, neither is going to die if they lose the ko
]
  ;W[rs]
  ;B[ps]
  ;W[cf]
  C[grolich: problem was that if white would get Q1 black's group there would not have been 100% ok, so black chose a safe approach. 
cloudbrows: a bunch of p3's value is now transferred to the right side. not so simple, IMO
Chinitsu: oh this move feels good
kannikka: i want to see black k16
arczyx: black is losing time so much
arczyx: 10 minutes difference already
Samraku: Time is there to be used :)
cloudbrows: I imagine Lee is more used to blitzing
Samraku: the sooner you get to byo-yomi the sooner you get 40 extra seconds every single move
calantir: Yes, Ten is more accustomed to slow games
Tarqeq: hahaha
ObieTwice: Samraku: kyuverb? :)
HowToPlay?: 40 seconds a move should be more than enough time for Ten  to think anyway so hes fine 
arczyx: well black should just hope there won't be a super complicated fight later
Samraku: Just math and opinion :)
Tarqeq: they can think on each other's turn to a degree
anarhail: he's already well into the second minute of this move
ObieTwice: equally enjoyable, though
kannikka: well its maybe pretty fast compared to the japanese time settings
grolich: 40 seconds isn't enough for professionals to play well... In fact, even the top players of the world make quite a few mistakes in 1 minute per move... But that's ok, usually, the opponent has a similar problem sometime during the game :D
Tarqeq: they have 2 hour matches or somtehing in top insei classes, right?
HowToPlay?: this is mainly because hes reading 20moves ahead or something im sure 
Samraku: k16 now?
kannikka: something like that maybe yea
Samraku: or o17?
Chinitsu: I like k16
Samraku: nice and calm
]
  ;B[dg]
  C[Karet: Black does seem to have nice influence, I would be jealous of it and attack it like a madman
joerg: k16 or k17 is just asking for the r17 invasion
Chinitsu: Ten doesn't
kannikka: so k16 too passive....
Samraku: Black trying global style
Samraku: :)
Chinitsu: this is over concentrated?
joerg: normal shape would be c12, but that is too slow?
hahoney0c34b820302643d8: b is losing
Samraku: Is this even sente against white's corner?
QWX: go hajin go!
ObieTwice: ooh, i like e13... no idea why of course... just feel
joerg: well, d18 is still open
QWX:  we ll win
ObieTwice: d13 **
QWX: :)
Oni: go antti go
Chinitsu: Something like this right?. From move 59: D14 C13 E14 
joerg: don't think so

  ;W[df]
  C[Tarqeq: doubtful

  C[Oni: : )
kannikka: i believe black is going to extend up
Tarqeq: E13 is more like it, yeah
Ornable: black should not walk backgrounds

kannikka: use that influence
joerg: tenuki
Ornable: source - kageyama
Tarqeq:  - / / -
]
  ;B[fc]
  C[kannikka: or something like you allready have those e9 aand g9
grolich: Chinitsu: BC13 is a very bad shape move by black you should try to avoid in your variation :)
Tarqeq: C13 would ask for hane or something
Samraku: White has no points. How is she going to stop black from winning by a good margin?
Chinitsu: ah I just remember some variations saw in Cho Hye Yeon's blog a while ago
arczyx: black has less solid points I think
calantir: Black's moyo is not solid
Tufted Turtle: hah
arczyx: black's right can be invaded
Ornable: white has SOME points
]
  ;W[ej]
  C[Samraku: Shouldn't black be able to make the 30 odd points white has pretty easily?
grolich: Samraku: Quite the opposite - white has more points than black right now. right and top right aren't solid points at all.  need more moves later
Ornable: "easily"
Ornable: don't think so
calantir: yeah...but haylee is sneaky
anarhail: white has two and a half smallish corners and a small bottom
Samraku: Pros are really good at reducing, though.
grolich: black has more influence, not more points
anarhail: black has, uh, a lot of influence
]
  ;B[ek]
  C[joerg: rule of thumb is you can realise half of the points of a moyo
]
  ;W[di]
  C[Samraku: I don't see how white can invade enough, but I'm excited to see how it develops
GOing2: L17
kannikka: i still like k16
joerg: difficult to say what the right balance on top is
Samraku: Not going to die, but while it's living, can white stop black from getting too many poitns elswehre?
joerg: k16 is better now with f17
joerg: but after k16 r17 is still painful
Tarqeq: I think K16 is too close to the the left
YangHaiYing: mm
Chinitsu: F10
Samraku: apparently they have a strong variation for white on stream
arczyx: f15?
joerg: Tarqeq: it's a normal opening
Ornable: variation on stream. From move 66: F10 F11 G11 F12 
kannikka: f15 toos low?
Samraku: yep
Samraku: @Ornable ^
Cail: gosh i love variation sharing on here.
Roxiliano: f15
Chinitsu: F10 is good for both side imo
Tarqeq: I know, opening... there are stones nearby, now, that should be taken into account
Cail: hats off to dev team.

  ;B[hi]
  C[KgsSong: mm
joerg: hm. interesting
Karet: Oh
Samraku: f12 jumps out now
joerg: f15 certainly looked interesting from a moyo building perspective
Samraku: no, that gets cut
arczyx: yeah
QWX: blacks influence is gonna  turn into whites territory soon
Samraku: nvm; I have bad instincts :)
joerg: Tarqeq: the h17 invsaion works, but c17 is still open

  C[calantir: oh, the gauntlet has been thrown down!
joerg: I'm not saying f15 is really playable, but it is a good idea
Tufted Turtle: BOOM
Tufted Turtle: haha
Tufted Turtle: not boom...

  ;B[ob]
  C[Tufted Turtle: pop maybe
joerg: fighting
Chinitsu: eh?
Chinitsu: Too good for w?. From move 69: O18 P17 O16 Q14 J17 
kannikka: too good for w
]
  ;W[jc]
  C[kannikka: black p17 too passive
Oni: yeah
arczyx: i think that's fine for black
Tarqeq: O16 more like it
joerg: idea of p18 is to protect the corner
KgsSong: maybe is just me but I thought something like k16 then h11 was better
Tarqeq: why let the white build whole 3 wall if you can sacrifice one stone to prevent it
calantir: sooo....dans in chat...tell us who's winning!
]
  ;B[lc]
  C[KgsSong: is fine
anarhail: now we see if ten can handle OT
Samraku: Twitch stream said white was winning
joerg: KgsSong: it feels more natural, doesn't it?
Samraku: which was surprising to me
kannikka: p18 is an attacking move
JeansebL: I rember playing Ten here on OGS once...
calantir: Ten is almost in byo-yomi
JeansebL: remember*
Ornable: not necessarily winning
joerg: kannikka: both
kannikka: if you want to protect the corner q18 is better
Ornable: just favorable
KgsSong: mm yes I would play k16
KgsSong: seems quite nice
arczyx: black's running out of time
KgsSong: right now the game is even
brwnstn: does anyone have a link of the stream?
arczyx: and a fight about to break out
Samraku: Is that a mistake, playing a move with 3 secs of main time left?
grolich: white still has more points, so Ten still needs to show his influence using magic :) and I think it's beginning now :) game seems ok for both to me
calantir: stream http://www.twitch.tv/xhu98
brwnstn: thanks calantir
KgsSong: mm yes the game is quite even...b probably want to make thing's hard for white
kannikka: samraku, why would it be?
Mef: I'd be inclined to think W will have stronger endgame, so with so many solid points I'd pick white
Tarqeq: because you could lose 3 seconds and get 40 seconds more
KgsSong: but mm I think they game is little better for b right now
Samraku: yes, tarqeq
KgsSong: but it is still a bit even
Tarqeq: but there will be hardly difference now
]
  ;W[ec]
  C[Samraku: Can white do this?
joerg: protect the corner...
Samraku: wouldn't it weaken her k17 stones?
arczyx: cash is good
calantir: Ten's endgame/counting is reputedly his strength
kannikka: yes
]
  ;B[gd]
  C[kannikka: maybe white thinks she can live with k17 either way
Samraku: I guess
]
  ;W[je]
  C[KgsSong: no j mp
KgsSong: see?
joerg: well, w can't pressure f17 as long as b has c17
KgsSong: the stones r a bit light nice open area as well
matburt: Thanks :)
]
  ;B[le]
  C[joerg: so taking that away first makes it easier to fight with k17
Cail: that's a lot of black to run into >_<
Ornable: white actually has an option to steal black's eyes if he plays c17
]
  ;W[hf]
  C[anarhail: w plays lightly to live in the center, takes away b's potential there
KgsSong: these r just
KgsSong: natural moves
Chinitsu: b can only f17 if the F17 group is strong enough
Chinitsu: *c17 I mean
Ornable: exactly
]
  ;B[eb]
  ;W[db]
  C[Samraku: and now corner is secure, no?
joerg: Chinitsu: even with c14/c15 b can live?
joerg: after c17
arczyx: can black live there?
arczyx: i'm not sure
joerg: (before 17)
Chinitsu: yes, c17 will live, f17 will die
Chinitsu: that's why f17 must be stable first
joerg: that's ok as exchange?
]
  ;B[ef]
  C[KgsSong: and I actually was not rlly thinking of e17... mm
KgsSong: thought the board shown was a time to think a bit
JeansebL: Let's see if B can gain enough from this attack
kannikka: why i feel that e14 is not active enough?
joerg: how to deal with f15?
calantir: i'm very curious how white can live here
Samraku: me too
Tufted Turtle: looks dicey
asdf1234: 220 viewers is very nice
arczyx: well white lives if she kills black
kannikka: how do you do a variation?
Tufted Turtle: ha
Mef: The stream mentioned G13, looks it could be tough to deal with
QWX: go hajin, we can live there 
calantir: analyze game from the right side menu kannikka

ObieTwice: always

  C[KgsSong: well it did feel white would have to go to that area I was thinking of g12 before this g14 move but she played it anyway for safer stronger connection I guess

KgsSong: and the exchange itself is not enough
arczyx: white's top need to live first
KgsSong: so it s not good overall
calantir: well maybe now white can make an eye in the center
]
  ;W[fk]
  C[calantir: oh, f9
joerg: :)
]
  ;B[fl]
  C[KgsSong: I guess she has no choice though
Samraku: Haylee fears no moyo :)
JeansebL: W is not scared at all XD
ObieTwice: how large can black right get by squeezing white top?
joerg: there is still the threat of f12 I guess
Mef: W is confident she can pull a rabbit out of the hat
HowToPlay?: this seems good for black though? 
Tarqeq: all the talk of moyo reminds me of Austin Powers
KgsSong: it is good for black
HowToPlay?: it helps his shape 
Chinitsu: Swimming with Haylee, live in 5 minutes
HowToPlay?: cause cutting at E8 ends in gote for white
Samraku: Well, pros are really good at living,r ight?
calantir: Haylee's time is ticking down
Ornable:  pros are also really good at killing
]
  ;W[dh]
  C[Samraku: and living
HowToPlay?: blacks better off not connect at E8 i think
billybones: F12
]
  ;B[id]
  C[KgsSong: no attack
calantir: peep!
]
  ;W[jd]
  C[joerg: reduce eye space
KgsSong: white should have done l13 or something :/

  C[Chinitsu: !
anarhail: !
Yunca: why is the youtube stream so delayed ~_~

GOing2: L14?

  ;W[lf]
  C[joerg: ah, sorry, misread :)
Yunca: there's a live youtube Xhu98 stream yes
calantir: the youtube and twitch streams are the same
JeansebL: I have a question for Calvin. What's the next tournament he planning to play in ? :)
Cail: ah, gotcha
ObieTwice: i feel like white top can live... i think black just needs to max profit on right in the process
Oni: N15
]
  ;B[if]
  C[Chinitsu: N15
HowToPlay?: i would of played J14 s well =D
]
  ;W[ld]
  C[KgsSong: the game is still quite good for black
calantir: will black get to come back and play E8?
Mef: When the top white lives, there's a good chance it does so in sente
]
  ;B[md]
  C[KgsSong: seems like white will have to do something on right side
JeansebL: That wedge is great XD
gooooo: has white played in any pro tournaments?
Samraku: yes
JeansebL: lol goooo
lurch: when blacks gets sente to play e8 w is lost

  C[JeansebL: she still does regularly
HowToPlay?: interesting 
Chinitsu: she won against Rui Naiwei in her first game
gooooo: ah nice
joerg: lurch: e8 is something that b was originally supposed to have

  C[AlphaStarburst: white
lurch: told you :)
KgsSong: mm
KgsSong: black is ahead for sure
HowToPlay?: black is ahead
Chinitsu: I was about to say L15 is gote and black will E8 xD
KgsSong: even with this bad shape and such for black
KgsSong: the game is good for black
calantir: but now white has miai to live, yes?
calantir: can take sente
Chinitsu: but G12 group is pretty much dead
KgsSong: white's main place to go is right side
Chinitsu: so black is comfortable
HowToPlay?: g12 is dead yeah 
Mef: I think I still like white here
calantir: yeah, let's see if white plays on the right
HowToPlay?: no life there
anarhail: g12 is ko threats
grolich: "main" place to go? or only place? :O :) hard to find another one
calantir: maybe threaten to connect up with G14 group first
kannikka: i think this is good for W
Mef: B still doesn't have solid points
]
  ;W[qg]
  C[KgsSong: white must go around right side or there is not chance of winning
KgsSong: see?
Tarqeq: Haylee is almost in byo-yomi
grolich: yeah, which is why I said it's quite simply the only place to go :)
KgsSong: main or only is fine I say main because some people may play elsewhere to do something
HowToPlay?: Ten:  still has all 3 byo yomis as well

  ;B[qh]
  C[KgsSong: but right is the main area white should do

KgsSong: b has to there is not
Chinitsu: also HowToPlay is scretly 3p
HowToPlay?: xp
KgsSong: no way b will win if he let's white connect
Tarqeq: L14, now?
HowToPlay?: nah that was just a easy read 
Tarqeq: :D
KgsSong: will be nosense
eldorago: its already connected
HowToPlay?: you have such an obsession with L14

  C[HowToPlay?: you have suggested it 4 times in a row

  C[Tarqeq: :D it's hard for me to leave the thought once I invested into it
KgsSong: yes white couldve just s15 and ahead by a nice amount but maybe she think's it was enough? I am not sure

Oni: go Antti
dneg: looks dangerous...

  C[Yunca: L14 lol?. From move 140: L14 H18 
HowToPlay?: heres the thing though if J12 can live 
HowToPlay?: then this was all good for white 
QWX: wasnt white ahead , why so complexity :(
Chinitsu: subscribe for more swiming lessons with Haylee
HowToPlay?: so if white read that it lives then its correct play 
dneg: haylee whyyyy
dneg: but maybe she read thru it...
KgsSong: ?

  C[KgsSong: this is fine
joerg: g11 getting cut is starting to become a threat
GOing2: Not getting paid for the game, why not have fun and entertain the audience

  C[KgsSong: black
KgsSong: can not cut at tengen
Mef: I have a feeling that Haylee won't shy away from what she thinks is the best game because it's complex (=
KgsSong: there i still ajo around g11 area
KgsSong: aji*

HowToPlay?: no
HowToPlay?: those stones dont matter right now

guoming.huang: this b is weak 1p
Chinitsu: live is trying to black?
JeansebL: This really seems like an attempt at making the game interesting :p. From move 132: 
guoming.huang: weak among 1ps
luckymedie: Black is not weak haha
guoming.huang: very
KgsSong: b had to go to go for kill but I don't see how he will kill

  ;B[lk]
  C[KgsSong: has*
luckymedie: He was top insei so if he is weak then we have problems
KgsSong: mhm something like this
sai0716: wat happen to this game ?
KgsSong: the cut does not work
KgsSong: for black
]
  ;W[ik]
  C[KgsSong: if white lives she has ahead around 15 points or so
Chinitsu: can you share the cut variation?
grolich: the cut loses the connection for the 3 stones on the left I think
luckymedie: Korean pro's are strong and Haylee is one of the stronger korean pro's4
ObieTwice: don't confuse weak skill level with young players in front of record setting audience
grolich: would have lost...
ObieTwice: or do it... either way, it's a fluid game
